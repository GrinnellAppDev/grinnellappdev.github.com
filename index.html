            <h2>1 General Information</h2>
            
            <p>
              We are a subsection of the TC corps which focuses on application development. In the course of doing this, we interface with a host of servers and content types in addition to working on the Web, iOS, Android, and Windows phone systems. Our overarching objective is to produce and maintain applications which enhance the information technology foundation on campus, and to give interested students the opportunity to develop software in a professional environment.
            
            <h2>2 Job Positions</h2>
            
            <p>
              In order to function efficiently and produce high quality products, we have organized our team into a logical hierarchy. This has been a response to the dramatic increase in our active membership and the range of applications which we have been hired to develop. Our positions are relative to each project, and we have two logistical-and-technical supervisors who direct group meetings, assign members to projects, and manage the education of new members.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.1 Group Leader</h3>
            
            <p>
              The group leader is the overall director of the group. He or she is a TCC and should speak for the group, interface with the rest of the TCC administration team, find new clients, and maintain relationships with current clients.. The group leader is also responsible for selecting and training the next group leader.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.2 Project Manager</h3>
            
            <p>
              In charge of interacting with the client regarding the application and tracking all of the teams producing the application. Project manager should facilitate team meetings and direct the flow of the project.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.3 Senior Developer</h3>
           
            <p> 
              Manages deadlines and work on a single platform (iOS, Android, Windows), trains and collaborates with the junior developer, and works directly with the graphic artist.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.4 Junior Developer</h3>
            
            <p>
              Focuses entirely on coding the application and gaining first hand experience with development.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.5 Graphic Artist</h3>
            
            <p>
              Separate from the training process and developer hierarchy. They focus entirely on producing the necessary images, icons, and layouts for the application.
            
          
            </ul>
            <ul>

            <h2>3 Training</h2>

            <li>
            <h3>3.1 TC Corps</h3>
            
            <p>
              As a student group, we are open to all members of the student body, but as a TC group, we try to only accept students who are dedicated to being active members of AppDev and the TC corps. For TCs interested in joining AppDev, we ask that they either submit a mini-resume and/or have a short interview to discuss their interest in development and software background. New TC trainees will be given a short period of paid time to complete their training, while non-TC members will not be given this grace period.
            
            <li>
            <h3>3.2 Education</h3>
            
            <p>
              To address the number of students who have joined AppDev without the discipline or interest to develop applications, we have implemented a more rigorous training process. We are open to all TCs, and we have collected a range of educational materials and sample projects for new members to work on. While they are working through these materials, senior group members will spend a small portion of time each week meeting with trainees to answer questions and evaluate their performance. Once a trainee has built a range of applications, and has shown that they have the skill and dedication to work on a paid project, they will be eligible to work on new projects as Junior Developers.
