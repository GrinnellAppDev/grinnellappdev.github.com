            <h2>1 General Information</h2>
            
            <p>
              We are a Grinnell College student group. We focus on application development, and, in doing so, we interface with a host of servers and content types in addition to working on a range of platforms including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Web. Our mission is to produce and maintain applications which enhance the information technology foundation on campus, and to give interested students the opportunity to develop software in a professional environment.
            
            <h2>2 Job Positions</h2>
            
            <p>
              In order to function efficiently and produce high quality products, we have organized our team into a logical hierarchy. This has been a response to the dramatic increase in our active membership and the range of applications which we have been hired to develop. Our positions are relative to each project, and we have two logistical-and-technical supervisors who direct group meetings, assign members to projects, and manage the education of new members.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.1 Group Leader</h3>
            
            <p>
              The group leader is the overall director of the group. He or she should speak for the group, interface with group sponsors including SGA and SPARQ, find new clients, and maintain relationships with current clients.. The group leader is also responsible for selecting and training the next group leader.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.2 Project Manager</h3>
            
            <p>
              In charge of interacting with the client regarding the application and tracking all of the teams producing the application. Project manager should facilitate team meetings and direct the flow of the project.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.3 Senior Developer</h3>
           
            <p> 
              Manages deadlines and work on a single platform (iOS, Android, Windows), trains and collaborates with the junior developer, and works directly with the graphic artist.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.4 Junior Developer</h3>
            
            <p>
              Focuses entirely on coding the application and gaining first hand experience with development.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.5 Graphic Artist</h3>
            
            <p>
              Separate from the training process and developer hierarchy. They focus entirely on producing the necessary images, icons, and layouts for the application.
            
            <li>
            <h3>2.6 Trainee</h3>
            <p>
              New members enter the group as trainees.  Trainees work through projects in a guided and mentored environment.  Once they have completed basic tasks demonstrating their knowledge, they may be place on a project as a junior developer.

          
            </ul>
            <ul>

            <h2>3 Training</h2>

            <p>
              As a student group, we are open to all members of the student body. Unfortunately, we currently cannot pay new members while they are training.
            
            <li>
            <h3>3.1 Education</h3>
            
            <p>
              To ensure all members of the group are able to contribute in a meaningful way to projects, we ask that all new members complete a guided training process.  we have collected a range of educational materials and sample projects for new members to work on. While they are working through these materials, senior group members will spend a small portion of time each week meeting with trainees to answer questions and evaluate their performance. Once a trainee has built a range of applications, and has shown that they have the skill and dedication to work on a paid project, they will be eligible to work on new projects as Junior Developers.
